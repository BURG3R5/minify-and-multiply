# minify-and-multiply

_Minify and Multiply_ is a cookie clicker game unlike any other! This one can be installed as an extension into the popular IDE **Visual Studio Code** which means you can play it while developing new and exciting software!

### Debugging session not going well? Take a break and manage a business!

## Story

Your factory makes a product. But due to its size, you can only sell a limited number of products per shipment. Well how about you trim its size a little? Awesome, now you can sell more products!

But wait, soon you'll run into the minimum scientific possible size! No worries: why don't you do some science stuff to it? Throw a few testtubes around and _Voila!_ science has made the impossible possible again!

Ugh, I'm tired after all this machining and selling and sciencing, aren't you? Let's hire salesmen, engineers and scientists to do your job for you! They'll help you take this product to `Infinity` and beyond\*!
